# SoundPositioner
This app serves as an input to Wekinator and, as such provides a number of extracted features. The features are extracted from a stereo audio input with the intention that they could, in conjungtion with appropriate Wekinator configuration and adequate training, form a machine learning system which is able to resolve the spacial location of a sound source. The envisaged system requires the use of a stereo microphone, or pair of mono mcrophones spaced apart appropriately.
